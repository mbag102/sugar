{"name":"Sugar","tagline":"Finally an Android equivalent to iOS Core-Data","body":"# Sugar ORM\r\nThis is a library that makes SQL Database interactions much easier than standard SQLite. This provides many features and helper methods that can be used for even the most complicated Database schemas.\r\n\r\n###Note\r\nThis is a fork from the original [Sugar Orm] (http://satyan.github.io/sugar). I have added many of my own features and will be maintaining this project for the forseable future.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n- Automatic schema generation\r\n- Complex model support\r\n- Object relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-To-One, and Many-To-Many)\r\n- Specifying a custom field to be the primary key (@Id annotation)\r\n- Helper query methods such as findUnique and findByRelationship\r\n- Object Cascading\r\n- Lazy loading of objects\r\n\r\n##Future features\r\n- Eager loading of objects\r\n\r\nLet me know what features are important or bugs you encounter and I will do my best to fix them. I use this in many of my own projects and have found great success.\r\n\r\n###For those of you looking to use this DB for offline data storage (caching), Check out [Spice] (http://github.com/mbag102/spice)\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Sugar?
